CF's way:
          Attempt to force cf-content to display to fix the form "bug" on Gecko/FireFox
          Wait 5850 seconds, lying about "wait up to 5 seconds" when it's "close" to 6 seconds.
          Make a temp 'div' and 'a' tag to get the domain for later, don't know what happened to document.domain but lets not use it.
          Do calculations and add the length of the domain name to the answer and submit the form.
          And clearly doesn't check if it even has gone one second since the user requested the token...
